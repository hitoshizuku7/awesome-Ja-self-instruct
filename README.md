# High-quality Japanese Instruction Dataset

This is a Japanese dataset with Alpaca format.

## Process

We revisited the original self-instruct method.

Our method translates that small number of seed tasks into Japanese and manually post-edits them to achieve native-level quality. 
Then we utilize GPT-4 to generate high-quality Japanese data directly.
